#The lab 10 had been done by following these instructions:
Create an inventory system for grocery store using Windows forms called Winforms.Inventory
Create a view to list items from the flat file on initial load
Clicking the add item should launch the add item view to insert an item into the flat file.
Clicking delete should remove an item based on the item selected, and should prompt the user with a popup asking if they want to delete before actually removing the item.
